This code is relevant for our paper "High Coverage Highly Accurate Long-Read Sequencing of a Mouse Neuronal Cell Line Using the PacBio Revio Sequencer" where we sequenced the Neuro-2a on a Pacific Biosciences Revio sequencer. We sequenced this cell line using 3 Revio SMRT Cells with a total coverage of 98x.
