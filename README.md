This code is relevant for our paper "High Coverage Highly Accurate Long-Read Sequencing of a Mouse Neuronal Cell Line Using the PacBio Revio Sequencer" where we sequenced the Neuro-2a on a Pacific Biosciences Revio sequencer. We sequenced this cell line using 3 Revio SMRT Cells with a total coverage of 98x.

The analyses include
* pbmm2
* deepvariant
* pbsv
* methylation
* hifiasm 
* hicanu 

The raw data and variant calls are available as described in our preprint at a Globus link. We also have deposited the `.fastq.gz` files in NCBI SRA at the following link: https:/[/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/SRX23616066](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/SRX23616066).
